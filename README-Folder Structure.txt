   NOTE: (1) refers to the output generated from Sequential Carving
         (2) refers to the output generated from Sequential + Fragmented Carving

   Each sub-folder in folder 2.1.1 contains an additional README file for describing each recovery process.

  2.2) carving_comparison

       This folder contains the carved output that is generated by the following
       carving tools:

	1. Adroit Photo Forensics output (Proprietary carving tool)
	2. Scalpel output(Open source)

	The carved output from these two carving tools is used for evaluating the 
	proposed carving method i.e The number of valid JPEG files will be compared
	with each other. The more valid carved JPEG files, the more robust the file carving tool.

      2.2.1) Adroit Photo Forensics 2013 output: output generated by APF

             This folder contains the output generated from Adroit Photo Forensic (APF).
             APF is a proprietary image file carving tool and is currently one of the most robust
             image file carving tool used by the Digital Forensics.
             One can refer to http://digital-assembly.com/products/adroit-photo-forensics for more information.

             NOTE: This tool was purchased by the University of Malta's IT Services for the evaluation of this project.
             
             2.2.1.1) Folder structure
                      1. DFRWS-2006:           carved output from the DFRWS-2006 raw image
                      2. DFRWS-2007:           carved output from the DFRWS-2007 raw image
                      3. nps-2009-canon2-gen6: carved output from the nps-2009-canon2-gen6 disk image

             2.2.1.2) Description

                      Important: The output generataed by APF includes images of different file types.
                      For this reason, the generated output can be subdivided in the following folders:

                       1. JPEG
                       2. GIF
                       3. PNG
                       4. Others

                       The carved file types can then be classified in different categories such as:

                       1. Recovery Type
                           1.1 Embedded in Carved:       carved images that were embedded in other files
                           1.2 Invalid-Partially Carved: carved images that were not fully recovered
                           1.3 Sequentially Carved:      carved images that were sequentially recovered
                           1.4 Smart Carved:             carved images that were stored fragmented and smartly recovered
                           1.5 Active:                   carved images that were presently stored in the disk (non-deleted)
                           1.6 Embedded in Active:       carved images that were embedded in active files

                      2. Validity
                         2.1 Invalid/Partial:            contains invalid/partially carved images
                         2.2 Valid		         contains valid carved images

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      2.2.2) Scalpel output: output generated by Scalpel

             This folder contains the output generated from Scalpel which is an open-source
             file carver based on the header-to-footer file carving approach. 
             Source code is available at: https://github.com/sleuthkit/scalpel

             2.2.2.1) Folder structure
                      1. DFRWS-2006:           carved output from the DFRWS-2006 raw image
                      2. DFRWS-2007:           carved output from the DFRWS-2007 raw image
                      3. nps-2009-canon2-gen6: carved output from the nps-2009-canon2-gen6 disk image
                      4. scalpel.conf:         configuration file for scalpel in order to recover JPEG files

            Important: The generated output for each test case was MANUALLY divided in invalid
            and valid folders which contain invalid and valid JPEG images respectively.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2.3) test_sets - URL: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B51b8cbLqEBHNnRqOXp4QkY5dW8
       
       This folder can be downloaded directly from Google Drive. It contains the test sets that were both used for the evaluation of the implemented
       prototypic file carver and also for measuring the performance of other file carving tools (Adroit Photo Forensics
       and Scalpel). The latter was specifically intended for comparing the generated output by the proposed file carving tool
       with that obtained from the other file carving tools. 

       2.3.1) Folder Structure
